# Improved 3D integral imaging reconstruction with elemental image pixel rearrangement
It is new reconstruction algorithm in integral (light-field) imaging.  
The reseach based on [PERT (Pixel of the Elemental image Rearrangement Technique)](https://www.osapublishing.org/jdt/abstract.cfm?uri=jdt-5-2-61).  
I named it [PERTS (PERT considering the empty Space)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2040-8986/aaa391/meta).  
It is implemented in Matlab.

# Usage
Please run /src/PERTS.m and /src/VCR.m.  
You can compare the resolution between VCR(Volumetric computational reconstruction) using ISO12233 resolution chart.
